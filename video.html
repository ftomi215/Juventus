            <h1>A videó leírása</h1>
            <p class="videoszoveg">A videó a 2006-os calciopoli néven elhíresült bundabotrány történetét mutatja be angol nyelven, animáció és rajzok segítségével. Ezen botrány során a nagy olasz csapatokól derült ki, hoy csaltak a szezon során. Ezután eljárás indult a bundában részt vevő csapatok ellen. A birósági eljárás után a csapatokat megbuntettek pontlevonással, illetve kizárással a Bajnokok Ligájából. Ekkor a legtöbb játékos otthagyta a csapatokat és az olasz futball tekintélye visszaesett, az olasz csapatok már nem tudták hogy a korábbi sikereket, meggyengültek. Később az eljárás folytatódott és kiderült, hogy a Juventus valójában csak elszenvedője a botránynak és jogtalanül zárták ki őket az 1. osztályból.</p>

            <h2>A videó szövege</h2>

            <p class="videoszoveg" lang="en">
                The mere mention ‘Calciopoli’ stirs a
                variety of emotions in Italian football fans.

                Commonly referred to as a ‘match-fixing
                scandal’, it implicated a

                number of high profile teams including: Juventus,
                A.C. Milan, Fiorentina, and

                Lazio among others.
                The scandal first came to light as a consequence

                of investigations of
                prosecutors on the Italian football agency GEA World.

                Investigations were
                already being conducted regarding claims of

                doping by Juve’s team doctor in
                the 90s, when Police unearthed a serious of

                phone conversations between
                top executives and referee designators in

                Serie A. Despite being described as
                a ‘match-fixing scandal’, the actual allegation

                relates Juventus Sporting
                Director — Luciano Moggi — attempting

                to influence results by picking certain
                referees he considered more favorable to Juventus

                or more likely to err in
                favor of Juve on a dubious call.

                Transcripts of recorded telephone conversations
                published in Italian

                newspapers suggested that during the 2004-2005
                season, Moggi and Antonio

                Giraudo had conversations with several officials of Italian football to influence referee appointments.

                During the scandal it was claimed Gazzetta Dello

                Sport’s sales spiked by 50,000 copies a
                day, with Italian sports journalist

                Giancarlo Galavotti claiming, ‘Even the
                old women going to the market in the

                morning want to read about this - it is astonishing.”

                On 4 July 2006, the Italian Football Federation's
                prosecutor, Stefano Palazzi,

                called for all four clubs at the centre of
                the scandal to be thrown out of Serie

                A. Lazio, Fiorentina and Juventus were all
                initially demoted to Serie B, with

                varying degrees of points deductions for each clubs.

                The case underwent a
                lengthy set of appeals.

                Ultimately, it was Juventus that incurred
                the harshest penalty.

                The prosecution alleged Moggi & Giraudo along

                with referee designators Pairetto
                & Bergamo created a system to alter the outcome

                of matches, and other teams ( such as Lazio and Fiorentina) "used" that system too.

                On the other hand, Milan tried to create an alternative system with Collina & some linesmen.

                According to the investigations, Moggi had made phone calls to

                referees using swiss simcards to avoid wiretaps
                from the police.

                The combination of these two things was enough

                to punish Juventus, handing
                down the severest punishment.

                The Old Lady was demoted to Serie B,
                stripped of league titles from 2004-05 and

                2005-06, the latter of which was
                given to Inter Milan, and deducted nine points

                after appealing an initial
                deduction of 30 points.

                Of the other clubs, Milan were deducted 8
                points for the upcoming season, 30

                points from the previous campaign, and forced to play one game behind closed doors.

                Reggiana were deducted 9 points and fined £20,000.

                Lazio were forced to place two games behind
                closed doors, deducted 3 points

                for the upcoming campaign, and removed from the UEFA Cup.

                Fiorentina were
                docked 15 points, forced to play two games

                behind closed doors, as well as
                being removed from the upcoming Champions

                League.​
                Now in Italy’s second tier, Juve’s demotion

                sparked an exodous of players
                including Lillian Thuram, Zlatan Ibrahimovic,

                Patrick Vieira and World Cup
                winning defender Fabio Cannavaro.

                Some players did stay, including Pavel
                Nedved, Gianluigi Buffon, David Trezeguet

                and Alessandro Del Piero.

                Juventus initially announced their intention
                to appeal through the Italian

                administrative courts, but later dropped their
                appeal the day before it was to be heard.

                The club did this because the court that was
                due to judge them had

                already rejected the appeals of other clubs
                just days before, and as such Juve

                believed it was a lost cause.

                The Juventus board resigned in mid-May, followed shortly by Moggi.

                The once bespectacled mastermind of Juventus was later banned from football for life.

                Speaking on the matter, Moggi said, “I don’t have either the strength nor the

                willingness to answer any question.

                I miss my soul, it has been killed.

                Tomorrow I’ll be resigning, since tonight
                the football world isn’t my world anymore.

                I’ll think only to defend myself from all
                allegations and wicked actions.”

                On September 9, 2015, the Supreme Court released a 150-page document explaining the final ruling of the
                case.

                Moggi’s remaining charges were
                cancelled without a new trial due to statute

                of limitations, but the court made
                clear that his unwarranted activities incurred

                significant damage to Italian football, not only in sporting, but also in economic terms.

                The court confirmed that Moggi was actively
                involved in the sporting fraud

                which was intended to favor Juventus and increase his own personal benefits.

                The document also stated that Moggi had "unjustified
                and excessive

                power within Italian football," which he used
                to exert influence over referees,

                other club officials and media, thereby creating "an illegal system to

                condition matches of the 2004/05 championship
                (and not just those)."
